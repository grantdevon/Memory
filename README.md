These rules have been met:
1. The game should consist of 2 players
2. Only 1 player can play at a time.
3. Shuffle the deck of cards
4. Display all 54 cards (jokers included) face down
5. Clicking the back of a card should turn a card over
6. Player can turn over 2 cards at a time
7. When two cards are turned over:
    7.1 If the number and color of the cards match, the player collects the pair and the cards are removed from the board
    7.2 If the cards do not match, they are turned back over and remain in position
8. The players with the most cards wins

I have also made it that the jokers match.
